                <span style="font-size: xx-large;color:darkred;">Africa</span>, the second largest continent (after Asia), covers 
                about one-fifth of the Earth's total land area.<br>Africa is 
                certainly an adventure continent. With so many diverse species
                and habitats dominating from coast to coast, Africa's wildlife 
                is a sight to see. Africa is home to the Bush elephant in Africa,
                the largest living land animal and the second tallest after the giraffe. Now that's certainly something I'm not going to see at the Philadelphia Zoo!Africa is home to vast deserts, rainforests, rocky mountains, and lush grasslands. In these, abundance is unsurpassed in any other continent. Another magnificent sight in this vast continent is Mount Kilimanjaro and Lake Victoria. Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest peak in Africa, while Lake Victoria is the largest.</p>
